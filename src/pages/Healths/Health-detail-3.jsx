      <p>HPV Infection:</p>
      <p>
        Cervical cancer is strongly associated with HPV infection, particularly
        high-risk strains like HPV-16 and HPV-18. HPV is a common sexually
        transmitted infection, and most sexually active individuals will
        contract it at some point. In the majority of cases, the immune system
        clears the infection without causing harm. However, in some instances,
        persistent infection can lead to cervical cancer.
      </p>
      <p>Risk Factors:</p>
      <p>
        Several factors increase the risk of developing cervical cancer,
        including early sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, smoking, a
        weakened immune system, and a family history of the disease.
      </p>
      <p>Prevention and Screening:</p>
      <p>
        Cervical cancer can be prevented through vaccination and regular
        screening. The Pap smear is a common screening test that detects
        abnormal cervical cells before they become cancerous. HPV testing can
        identify high-risk strains of the virus. Early detection and treatment
        greatly improve the chances of successful recovery.
      </p>
      <p>HPV Vaccine:</p>
      <p>
        The HPV vaccine is a highly effective preventive measure against HPV
        infection and cervical cancer. It is primarily administered to
        adolescents and young adults but can also benefit individuals of all
        ages. There are several types of HPV vaccines available, with the most
        common ones targeting the most prevalent high-risk strains, including
        HPV-16 and HPV-18.
