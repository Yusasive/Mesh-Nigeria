        Mapping of Muslim Health Facilities
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg font-normal text-justify">
        In September 2020, MESH started the mapping of all Muslim health
        facilities across the country. The purpose of the mapping was to have a
        comprehensive database of Muslim health facilities in Nigeria. The data
        generated will be used to coordinate the responses to reduce the scourge
        of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious disease in
        Nigeria. From the responses, a total of 15 Muslim health facilities are
        in existence and are put in the database. There are 8 facilities in FCT.
        In addition, Adamawa, Kaduna, Oyo, Sokoto and Kwara States have 1
        facility each and 2 in Taraba State.

        Medical Outreach in Shekuto Community of FCT
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg font-normal text-justify">
        MESH implemented its first health program tagged Shetuko Medical
        Outreach. The Medical Outreach was organized in collaboration with
        Islamic Medical Association of Nigeria (IMAN) to provide and contribute
        to the improved healthcare of people in Shetuko Community of Kuje Area
        Council in FCT. IMAN is the medical organization under the NSCIA which
        is founded to render and enhance health care service delivery by
        organizing outreach medical services in communities. IMAN acquired a
        building with about 6 rooms in Shetuko community, an old rural
        settlement in Kuje area council, where there is no clinic or dispensary
        to serve the community on medical issues.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg font-normal text-justify">
        The Organisation intends to use the building as health care facility to
        provide health care services to the residents. It therefore submitted a
        Medical Outreach request for funding to MESH. After critical analysis of
        the request and needs assessment to the community, MESH approved the
        proposal and wrote for the release of the fund to implement the project
        in March 2020. The program was postponed due to COVID-19 lockdown in the
        country.
