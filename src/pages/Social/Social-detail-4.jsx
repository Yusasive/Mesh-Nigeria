        The last training was held in Lafia on 1st and 2nd February 2018. It was
        also for the deaf community in Nasarawa State. There were 60 students
        mobilized from the Secondary School for Special Needs Education and 46
        non-students in the training. The Special Adviser to the Governor on
        Gender and Disability Matters, Dr. (Hon) Hajarat Danyaro Ibrahim, gave a
        goodwill message and formally opened the training. Soon after the
        training, a proposal was prepared on behalf of the Nasarawa State Deaf
        Association and submitted to the Nasarawa Government with the hope of
        getting funds to organize more training in the State, offer vocational
        training and increase access to healthcare information by engaging sign
        interpreters at the government health facilities.
